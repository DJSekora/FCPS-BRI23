CIPHER WARS REFLECTION
Answer the following questions on paper or in a text document, hand in by end of class:

1. How did you contribute to your group during the Planning Phase (the first class session, where we met with the Cryptology students)?

2. How did you contribute to your group during the Implementation Phase (the second class session, where we prepared our encryption/decryption code)?

3. How did you contribute to your group during the Messaging Phase (the last class session, where we sent our messages)?

4. Do you feel that you used your time wisely (just you, not your teammates)?

5. If you had the chance to go back in time and do it again, what would you change about your team's approach?

6. Evaluate your teammates. Who exhibited leadership, who performed well under pressure, and who didn't pull their weight?

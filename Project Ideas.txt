Tetris


WORD GAMES
Anagram generator
Text Twist (Spelling Bee, Wordscapes, etc., where you have a set of letters and have to find words using only those letters. May or may not allow repeating the same letter)
Typing practice game
Word search (player or solver)
Wordle (player or solver)


OTHER GAMES
Blackjack/Poker
Board games (Monopoly, Uno)
Clicker Games (like Cookie Clicker)
Puzzle Games (like the one where you sort colored liquids, or the one where you flip all the light switches to the same color)
Tower Defense
Yahtzee (or similar dice-based game)


TEXT-BASED PROJECTS
Encryption/decryption protocol
Poetry generator
Spelling checker
Text compression
Text editor (optional features: save/load, word wrap, font selection)
Word counter (count the number of occurrences of each word in a file and sort them by frequency)(recommended: look up hash tables)


IMAGE-BASED PROJECTS
Fractal drawer (requires some math)
Image compressor (lossy or loss-less)
Image editor (basic coloring, resizing, cropping, flipping, rotating, etc.)
Image file format creation (probably necessary to do this for the compressor)
Tileset editor for a 2D game
"Video player" (read in a series of image files, display them in sequence with a fixed delay)


OTHER PROJECTS
BigInteger class (write an object type that uses arrays to allow storage of and computation with integers larger than 64 bits)
Circuit simulator
File browser (like Windows Explorer)
Graphical GUI builder
Graphing calculator
Interactive animation (pressing different keys or buttons generates different types of animations, preferably customizable)
Machine learning algorithm (simple, like a perceptron)
Make your own Terminal/Command Prompt (implement: cd, ls, cat, touch, text editor)
Monte Carlo simulations to estimate probability (repeat a randomized trial many times, count the number of times each outcome appears - can use this to estimate poker odds, Monty Hall problem, etc.)
Physics particle simulation
Virtual piano (requires learning about sound synthesis)
Write a code generator
Write your own toy programming language ("compiles" to Java code)


RESEARCH TOPICS
AI safety and the Singularity
Boolean (propositional) logic rules for simplifying expressions (and/or circuits)
Cheat codes for video games (how they're discovered, how they're injected)
Chip and circuit design and optimization (including physical limits on size)
Computational complexity (big O notation for space and time requirements)
Cryptocurrency (blockchain, ethics, mining, etc.)
Data structures and their space/time considerations:
 * linked lists with and without tail reference/double linking
 * queus and stacks, comparing implementations with ArrayList vs LinkedList
 * hash tables
 * binary trees (including applications of binary search trees and heaps)
 * priority queues
Encryption (historical, and/or modern standards like RSA, AES, etc.)
Frame rates
Graph theory
History of long-term computer information storage (magnetic tape, HDD/spinning disk drives, SSD/solid state drives, etc.)
Machine learning (historical, and/or modern trends like how ChatGPT works)
Networking and the Internet
Operating systems (history, how they're built, what they're for)
Parallel computing (can include graphics cards)
Programming languages (how and why languages are made, how a selection of basic programs works in several different languages, etc.)
Search algorithms (breadth-first search, depth-first search, uniform cost search, A*)
Theory of computation (start with Discrete Finite Automata (DFA) and then Context-Free Grammars (CFG))
Virtual machines
Viruses (but don't build and run one please)
